/**

 *        sequence of BlockPostalCode nodes.
 *
 * This class forms the Block Sequence Set (BSS) structure used to store postal
 * header records in a linked-block format. Each block is connected using
 * predecessor/successor links similar to Relative Block Number (RBN) behavior.

 * @brief Manages a linked list of BlockPostalCode objects.
 *
 * @details
 * Each BlockPostalCode contains:
 *   - A HeaderRecordPostalCodeItem
 *   - A predecessor pointer (prev)
 *   - A successor pointer (next)
 *
 * The BlockSequenceSetPostalCode class stores:
 *   - headBlock → pointer to the first block
 *   - tailBlock → pointer to the last block
 *   - itemCount → number of stored blocks
 *
 * New blocks are appended to the end (tail), maintaining predecessor and
 * successor relationships.
